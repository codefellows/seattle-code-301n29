# React and Forms

## Retros

- ESlint
  -config file provided in class Repo

- Project functionality and flow, how do you know?
  - Readable, Simplicity, Would it make sense at a glance
  - Refactoring

- Purpose of data flow and why props shouldn't be manipulated
  - React Data flows down - this.setState() single source of truth
  - Re-rendering

- Inline Styling vs Stylesheet
  - inline - quick, easy-target, over-ride / messy code if too much
  - style sheet - Bulk changes in style, More styling ability

- Retros
  - Agile project management methodology in the industry
  - quick notes recap questions 1-3
  - questions 4 and 5 are for me

- Demos will start pushing up during ending questions

## Overview

Today we will cover how React handles `forms` and the asynchronous nature of setting state.

## Class Outline

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic, `.sort()`
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Event
- Forms
- Event Listeners
- Event Handlers
- event.target

#### Execute

- Understand how to use a `form` in a React application
- Be able to send information collected from a form into a child component

## Notes

1. What is the difference between an event listener and an event handler?

1. If I am listening for an onChange on the input field, how to I access the value that the user is typing in?

1. If the form is my child component, how do I send the information collected from that form up to the parent component?
